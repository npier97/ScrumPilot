# Scrum Pilot (Still In Progress)

## Overview

**Scrum Pilot** is a collaborative tool designed to enhance the efficiency of scrum teams. This application allows team members (developers, product owners, and others) to estimate the complexity and effort required for tasks in a sprint. With a simple, interactive interface, Scrum Pilot empowers teams to make informed decisions and complete their sprints successfully.

## Features

- Scrum Poker Voting: Team members can evaluate tasks by selecting voting cards following Fibonacci or custom selectable formats.
- Room Creation: Create private rooms for your team to participate in the estimation process.
- Total Calculation: After all votes are cast, the app calculates the total and displays the collective estimation.
- Real-Time Collaboration: All participants can join in and see real-time updates.
- Easy Setup: No complex configurations neededâ€”simply create a room and invite your team members.
